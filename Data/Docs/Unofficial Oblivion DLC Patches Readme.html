<p class="h"><a name="description">1. Description</a></p>
The aim of this mod is to fix the bugs existing in the official mods released by Bethesda.

<br><br><b>NOTE:</b> These fixed plugins use the ESP master (aka mod de-isolation) method which means you still need the original plugins for these plugins to work! The plug-ins are not a redistribution of modified original Bethesda plug-ins, but contain only changes and have the original plug-ins set as masters. <b>Because of this, these are not standard plug-in ESP files. Merging, editing or otherwise modifying them using the Elder Scrolls Construction Set or other utilities may cause them to stop functioning or cause severe bugs in your game! The UODP plug-ins must load <i>after</i> the official plug-ins that they patch and <i>the official plug-ins must be present if the UODP patch ESP's are activated</i>, or Oblivion WILL crash on launch or load of a save.</b>

<br><br>The one exception to merging is that the DLCThievesDen - Unofficial Patch.esp and DLCThievesDen - Unofficial Patch - SSSB.esp files <b>are</b> safe to merge as they are both dependent on the same masters.

<br><br>It is recommended to not activate the Thieves Den' SSSB (Sigil Stone Sound Bug) fix plug-in <i>DLCThievesDen - Unofficial Patch - SSSB.esp</i> on an existing game, but rather only on a new game, as otherwise the middle deck of the Black Flag could lose its doors (as their position is stored in the save file) and/or any objects already dropped in this cell could be lost.

<br><br>If you find any bugs with the fixes or bugs with the official mods themselves that we haven't fixed yet, please report them to us.</b>

<br><br><p class="h"><a name="install">2. Installation</a></p>
<b>1.)</b> For the manual install version, extract "Unofficial Oblivion DLC Patches.7z" into your "Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion" folder.
<br><b>2.)</b> Start the Oblivion Launcher.
<br><b>3.)</b> Click "Data Files".
<br><b>4.)</b> Find and tick the patch esp's for the official mods you want to use.
<br><b>5.)</b> Click "OK" and you're done!

<br><br><b>NOTE:</b> Make sure the patch ESP's are loaded after the official plugins or they will NOT work and Oblivion may crash on load! Do not activate any of the UODP patch ESP's if the official plugins that they patch are not installed or this will cause Oblivion to crash on load as well!

<br><br><p class="h"><a name="uninstall">3. Uninstalling</a></p>
To uninstall the manual version, nothing special is needed, just delete what you extracted from the archive.

<p class="h"><a name="notes">4. Known Issues, Incompatibilities & Notes</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The Unofficial Oblivion DLC Patch (and anything else that uses ESP mastering/Mod De-Isolation to change the official plug-ins) <b>is not compatible with JOG's Official Plugins Unnerfed</b> as it modifies the original Bethesda ESP files; using the Unofficial Oblivion DLC Patch with Unnerfed plug-ins can cause Oblivion to crash on launch. The Unofficial Oblivion DLC Patches <b>is compatible with SM Plugins Refurbished</b> which does the same thing as Unnerfed but uses de-isolation instead of modifying the Bethesda files. If you use Refurbished, move its ESP files later than the Unofficial Oblivion DLC Patch ESP files in your load order to ensure that they work</li>
<li>If you use the Horse Armor Pack patch with Slof's Armored Horses, the Slof's horses' reins may disappear. Use dev_akm's compatibility patch instead</li>
</ul>
